# Chart.js, Canvas

I went through the steps of downloading the chart.js and reading over how to use it to create different sorts of graphs via html. I tried to install it as an extension into Visual Studio Code. But it doesn't look like I can. Looks like something you'd have to install into each repository you make and the call that folder to get the charts.

The Canvas API looks interesting as well, from what I can tell, it looks like a way to better organize and layout your page
