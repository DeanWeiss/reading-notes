## Blog Post: JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

As a general guide, Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations

Compression can be two types: Lossless and lossy.

Lossless - possible to reconstruct the original image from the compressed image because there is no information loss during compression.
Lossy - Always have superior compression ration to lossless. But can loose quality of image.

JPEG: is a lossy compression. Doesn't support transparency. Support around 16 million colors.
PNG: Is a lossless image. supports transparency in two ways. png8 and png24. PNG8 - 246 colors, PNG24 - 16 million collars
GIF: lossless image. Supports transparency by declaring a single color. 256 colors. Only one that supports animation.
