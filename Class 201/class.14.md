#Class 14 Reading Notes

## Googles Perfect Team
This was an interesting read. The search for how to create the perfect team makes sense for a company as large as Google, who have the resources to spend. The realization that different people work better in different circumstances and that one style of leadership doesn't work for everyone seems self evident to me. 

Everyone wants to be respected, want's their voice heard and to feel like they are contributing to the team as a whole. Having group norms that are vital to success also makes sense to me, its very akin to having different groups of friends and each group has different things that are considered acceptable in that group.

## CSS Transforms, Transitions and Animations

Transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. 
You can rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. You can also scale, translate and skew the element.

The tansition-property determines which properties will be in altered in conjunction with other properties.  

A few of the best transition effects are: Fade In, Change Color, Grow and Shrink, Rotate Elements, Square to Circle, 3d Shadow, Swing, Inset Border.

## Things I want to know more about

Out of all of the different animations and transitions out there, I wonder which ones are the most effective and which ones are over used?
