<p>Structual Markup: these are elements that describe both headings and paragraphs. </p>

### Structual Markup

### Semantic Markup

Semantic Markup: These do not afffect the structure of the webpage, but do add extra information to the page. They basically describe elements to the browser.

<li>
    <ol>
        strong: make of importance, similiar to bold
        em: subtly changes the meaning, similiar to italics
        blodkquote: indents on the page for quoting.
        q: puts quoptes around something
        abbr: used for abbreviation and accronyms
        cite: for citations, looks like italics
        dfn: defining, some browsers make italics, safari and chrom don't.
        address: sometimes makes italics.
        ins and del: the del is a strikethrough and ins is an underline.
    </ol>
</li>



## Ducket HTML Book, Chapter 10 Introducing CSS, pp226-245

CSS essentially makes it seem like there is a invisible box around each HTML element.

CSS allows you to create rules that can control whats in each box. j

A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. The selector is the tag before the curly brackets and the declaration is what's inside the brackets.

Within that declaration there is a property and a value. The property says which aspects of the elemtna you want to change and the value is the setting you want to use for that property. An example would be that the property is a font type or color and the value is the type of font or color selected.

The LINK element will tell the HTML file where to find the CSS file. See page 235 for an example.

You can add !important after any property. This will say that it's more important than other rules that apply to the same element.

Inheritance - This means that the child elements of a page inherit from higher elements. This is case by case though, background colors and border properties are not inherited.



## Ducket JS Book, Basic JavaScript Instructions, pp53-84

### Basic JavaScript Instructions

Javascript is made up of statements that end in semi-colons. The curly brackets indicate the start and end of code block. Think of statements that give a specific instruction, each one needs a new line.

You can write comments in your code using the /* and */ this will not be processed by Javascript.

Variables are used to remember information for a short time. Once you leave the browser it forgets the information. Go to page 60 for more info on variables.

Javascript uses numbers, strings and true or false values known as Booleans.

Arrays: These are special variables that stores a list of values.

Values in arrays start at 0 not 1. 

Page 76 has a table of Arithmetic Opertators.

## Things I want to know more about

Why use abbr? Seems pointless and typing it out would just be easier.
