# CSS Layout

## Reading - CSS-Layout - "https://web.dev/learn/css/layout/"

The display property does two things. The first thing it does is determine if the box it is applied to acts as inline or block.

The display property also determines how an element's children should behave. For example, setting the display property to display: flex makes the box a block-level box, and also converts its children to flex items. This enables the flex properties that control alignment, ordering and flow.

There are two main layout mechanisms that create layout rules for multiple elements, flexbox and grid. They share similarities, but are designed to solve different layout problems.

## Ducket HTML: Chapter 15: Layout

Normal Flow- position:static
Relative Flow- position:relative
Absolute Positioning- position:absolute
Fixed Positioning- position:fixed
Overlapping Elements- z-index
Floating Elements- float
clearing floats- clear

Fixed Layouts: Do not change size based on browser.
Liquid Layouts: Do change size based on browser size.
