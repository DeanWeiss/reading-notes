## Ducket HTML Book

### Introduction

People access the web through Browsers such as firefox or chrome. When you try to access a webpage a request is sent to a special computer that is a web server. What we see on a website is HTML and CSS. HTML gives us the framework and CSS is what makes it look pretty.

### Chapter 1

HTML describes the structure of the page. The HTML code lives inside angled brackets called Elements. Usually there is an opening and closing tag for each element, but not always. 

Inside the tag you can have an attribute, which will tell you more about that element. There is a name and a value that is seperated by an = sign. 

### Chapter 8

Because there have been different versions of HTML over the years your webpage should always begin with a DOCTYPE declaration. 
You can use `<1-- -->` to add a comment to your code that won't be visible.

ID Attribute - This should be unique so that you can style it with CSS later. It can be a letter or an underscore, but not a number. 
Class Attribute - This will tell the code that the following text is more important than other code and it will prioritize it.
Block Elements - These are the headers, paragraph, ordered and unordered list.

The Div element allows you to group elements together in one block level box.
Span acts like an inline of div. 

Meta elements lives inside the head of the web page. It is not visible and does not have a closing tag. 

### Chapter 17

It seems like with the introduction of HTMl5 that simply using div to seperate the elements on a webpage is no longer done. Instead they are seperated into what they actually are, such as a header and foote, articles and aside.  This is so that developers can easily navigate their own and others code, to get to what they want.

Headers, Footers, navigation, Articles, Asides, Sections, Heading Groups, Figures, Section Elements and Links are all used to help identify parts of the webpage.

### Chapter 18

When making a website you need to think about who it is for, who will be using it? Why will they be using it and what they are trying to achieve. As well as what information they need to see and how often will they need to visit it?

Beacuse you have to answer all these questions it is good to build out a site map, that way you have a framework of what you need to accomplish before you start typing code.
