# JavaScript book, Ch 10. Error Handling and Debugging

Order of Execution - It helps to know the order in which scripts are processed.
Execution Contexts - Global Context, Function Context, Eval Context
    Global Context: Code that is in the script, but not in a function.
    Function Context: Code that is run with the function.
    Eval Context: Text is executed like code in an internal function.

Variable Scope - 
    Global Scope: A variable declared outside a function.
    Function-Level Scope: Variable declared within a function.

    The Stack: One line of code at a time, it stacks/piles the the new function on the task.

    Error Object: Can help you find where your mistake are and browsers have tools to help you read them.
