By default, a box is just big enough to hold its contents.

Box Dimenstins need height and width. You can use pixels, percentages or ems.

Percentages is relative to the size of the browser window.
EMS is based on the size of the text within. 

Limiting Width: You can set the min-width and max-width to determine how it will appear on different size screens.
Limitiding Height: Like width you can set the min-heigh and max-height. 

Overflow: If the content is too large to be contained, you can use the hidden or scroll property to determine how one sees the content.

Border, Margin and Padding: Border is for the boxes, it can be set to 0 pixels wide. Margin is the outside edge of the border. Padding is the space between border and content.

Border-Width is given as; thin, medium or thick or using pixels, not as percentages. 
        If you give pixels and specify all four sides it starts at the top and goes clockwise.
Border-Style: Solid, dotted, dashed, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, hidde/none. 
Border-Color: Specify color using RGB values, hex codes or CS color name. 
Border Shorthand: The border property allows you to specify the width,, style and color. In that order. 

Padding: Specifys how much room is between the border and its content. 
Margin: Controls the gap between boxes.

Centering: You can also center content. You will need to set the width of the box, then sen the right and left margins to auto. You will also need to center the text. 

You can also change the inline/block, hide boxes, Border images, add box shadows, round corners and elliptical shapes.
