## React lifecycle

Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
    Render happens first.

What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
    Mounting, Constructor in the Render Phase

Put the following things in the order that they happen: 
    Constructor, React Updates, render, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount,

What does componentDidMount do?
    It invokes after a component is mounted. It loads anything we need using a network request or initilize the DOM. Also a good place to set up subscriptions.

## React State Vs Props

What types of things can you pass in the props?
    Things you pass on to a function. 

What is the big difference between props and state?
    Props you pass into a component and State is handled inside the component.

When do we re-render our application?
    A prop is updated outside of the component and a State inside of the component.

What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
    A counter, A form,  something that needs to be rerendered or updated based on what the user has done.
