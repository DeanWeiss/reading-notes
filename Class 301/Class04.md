# Reacts and Forms

## React Docs

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
    input form element whose value is controlled by React 

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
    Update after every keystroke so that is shows back to the user as they type.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
    Have a drop down box for them to select.

## The Conditional
Why would we use a ternary operator?
    It shortens the code and is less to type.


Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
    if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

Rewritten:

x === y ? 'true' : 'false';

## Things I want to Know More About

I guessed at the 3rd question in React Docs. Couldn't find the answer in the reading.
